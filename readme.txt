== Description ==
Displays the latest commits of a github repo in the sidebar.

### Features

#### Sidebar Widget

The Plugin provides a sidebar widget which can be configured to display commits from a github repo in the sidebar. You can have multiple widgets with different repo configured for each one of them.

#### Template function

In addition to using the widget, you can also use the following template function to display the commits of a github repo, anywhere in the theme

`get_github_commits($user, $repo, $count);`

The following options can be passed in the $options array

- $user (string) - Github user name. 
- $repo (string) - Github repo name.
- count (int) - default 5 -  Number of recent commits to show

#### Custom field

You can also specify the repo for each post or page as a custom field. You can add it under the "WP Github Commits Page fields" section in the Add/Edit post screen.

#### Caching

The Plugin caches the commits that is retrieved from Github for 5 hours.

#### Styling using CSS

The Plugin adds the following CSS classes. If you want to customize the look of the widget then can change it by adding custom styles to these CSS classes.

- The outer `ul` tag has the class `github-commits`
- Every `li` tag has the class `github-commit`

### Troubleshooting

If you get timeouts or the error "WP HTTP Error: name lookup timed out" then it means that your server is not timing out before github can respond.

You can use the code from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/sudar/4945588) to increase the timeout.

### Translation

The pot file is available with the Plugin. If you are willing to do translation for the Plugin, use the pot file to create the .po files for your language and let me know. I will add it to the Plugin after giving credit to you.
